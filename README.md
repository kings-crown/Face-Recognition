# face
The python files have the code to detect a face and save a new face each time it appears in the images into the folder faces.

The code works only if the python version 2.x .
Please to look out for that.

The recognition isnt very accurate but it canbe used for simple codes requiring matching faces to users.
Also, there may be checkpoints file that shows up in the wholefaces file which make cause an errot, deleting it manually solves the problem.
